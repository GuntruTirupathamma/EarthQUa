Quake Map üåç


Description


Quake Map is a web-based interactive map that visualizes recent earthquake data from around the world. Users can view the location of earthquakes, their magnitudes, and other relevant information on a global map.


This project uses Leaflet.js for mapping and marker visualization. It provides an intuitive way to track seismic activity worldwide.
